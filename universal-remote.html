		<h2 class="project-title">How could a mobile app replace traditional remotes?</h2>
		<hr>
		<h4 style="margin-bottom: .3em; margin-top: .25em;">With a stereo, cable box, TV, and dvd player, you'd have to <b>switch between four remotes</b>. That’s crazy.</h4>
		<div class="primary-img">

		</div>
		<!-- ## rewrite -->
		<p>
			Now people can do everything from adjust their home's temperature, to summoning a black car for transport. People are becoming more comfortable using a single mobile devices to control the world around them. TV remotes are archaic, overcomplicated, and a TV control app would put less between them and their content.

		<h2>A Survey of the prospective audience</h2>

		<!-- ## Bigger -->
		<h5>Through a <a href="https://juliannorton.typeform.com/to/ifZ8SX">Typeform survey</a> and mechanical turk, I gathered insight into the good and bad. <small><a href="https://juliannorton.typeform.com/report/ifZ8SX/M952">View the statistics</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YkOJ5OCsTbB5qYU6FbiQH7uGGayN02hxUAWYA4dNo70/edit?usp=sharing">View the responses</a></small></h5>
		<!-- ## Call more attention to links^^ -->
		<!-- ## two column -->
		<h3>The good</h3>
		<ul>
			<!-- ## make clearer that this is a quote -->
			<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><blockquote>I like that the remote has glow-in-the-dark buttons, which makes it easy to see in the dark. I also like the shape of it. It feels very good in my hand.</blockquote></li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><blockquote>The remote controls all of the devices off one remote. Pressing the power button turns off the TV and the cable box together.</blockquote></li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><blockquote>On/Off buttons, changing displays, controlling volumes…</blockquote></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>The bad</h3>
		<ul>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><blockquote>The fact that I need two remotes to properly control my devices</blockquote></li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><blockquote>There are too many buttons that I never use, which get in the way sometimes.<br>It took a while for me to remember where some of my go-to buttons were.</blockquote></li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><blockquote>There are a lot of buttons that I never use. I don't know what they do. I would like bigger buttons.</blockquote></li>
			<!-- ## emphasize buttons  -->
			<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><blockquote>My universal remote doesn't work with the blu ray player</blockquote></li>
			<!-- ## delete one -->
			<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><blockquote>They get lost and drink batteries</blockquote></li>
			<i>It's worth noting that out of 30 responses, 7 people mentioned batteries dying</i>

				Adrian lives in the suburbs of long island and recently got a cable-subscription for her new TV. She doesn't like how cluttered remotes can be, and just wants to watch friends reruns every night and nothing else. She wants something simple she can use from her phone because she always loses the remote.

				Jim hates replacing the batteries in both his TV remote, and cablebox remote. Him and his family always have the TV on, even if just for background noise, fight over who can flip between channels.

		<h2>Conclusion and Next Steps</h2>
		<!-- ## Bold some of the important stuff -->
		<!-- ## Pound the points of the research -->
		<p>
			A Universal remote control app will undoubtly become more and more part of a mobile device experience. The app's focus though has to focus on the reality of the transition from hardware to software. The most successful universal remote app will be the one that respects where people are coming from, and guide them in the transition. A next step would be to investigate more the content suggestions and recommendations, as well as the possiblity of deprecating cable subscriptions all together.
